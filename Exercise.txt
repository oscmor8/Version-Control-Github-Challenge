The terminal is a way to speak to your computer using text commands instead of pressing buttons and menus. It's like a chat box where you type in what you want the computer to do, and it responds with text. You can use it to do many things like moving files, installing programs, and changing settings. It's useful for people who want to get things done quickly and efficiently. In coding, the terminal is used to installing specific packages, update, export, import work to platforms like GitHub. The terminal is also used to test code and display any errors.
